        <h3 id="a1">Personality</h3>
        <p id="a11">
          In the beginning of the series, Musashi was portrayed as a hot headed
          young man driven by his desire to become strong, with a very
          aggressive personality. One of the foremost reasons that drives
          Musashi to excel in sword-fighting, is his desire to overcome his
          father for all the harsh treatment given during his childhood and
          Musashi's incapability to rebel. This desire made him violent and
          feared by others, however Otsu was the only person who didn't fear
          him. In Vagabond he was obsessed with being "Invincible under the
          Heavens" until he realises that it was simply an empty title and how
          limited he was. When he was asked the definition of "Invincible under
          the Heavens", he compared it to a heat haze where it gets hot when one
          strives towards it but it fades when one reaches it. After destroying
          the Yoshioka clan, he becomes more gentle and peaceful but he
          understands he can't escape the spiral of death and killing. As he
          figured out that he's stuck in the spiral of death and killing, he
          felt killing others was like stabbing himself.

        <h3 id="a2">Relationships</h3>
        <p id="a22">
          Musashi's relationships with those around him shape his journey and
          character. His childhood friend Otsu becomes a significant figure in
          his life, as they bond over their shared loneliness. Musashi realizes
          he loves her but distances himself to protect her from the dangers of
          his life, though he later expresses a desire to live with her. Another
          childhood friend, Matahachi Honiden, was once considered Musashi's
          best friend, but their paths diverge after Matahachi’s betrayal. When
          they reunite, Musashi is deeply saddened by how much Matahachi has
          changed. Soho Takuan, an eccentric monk, serves as a mentor to
          Musashi, using harsh but effective methods to teach him valuable
          lessons, helping him grow both as a warrior and as a person. Sasaki
          Kojiro, initially not an enemy, shares an unspoken connection with
          Musashi, and they are instinctively drawn to each other when they meet
          again. Jotaro, Musashi's first disciple, forms a close bond with him
          as they both strive to become stronger. Although Musashi tries to
          leave Jotaro for his betterment, Jotaro and Otsu continue searching
          for Musashi, while Musashi occasionally wonders about Jotaro’s
          well-being during his journey.

          Musashi is unique in terms of his sword-skill for the unfamiliar
          movements and lack of style he uses. This is due to the fact that he
          spent most of his entire time in the forest having been labelled as a
          demon child by his village for his demeaning and wicked nature.
          Frankly, the forest is his home and where his master resides. He is
          known for his arm strength, in the Yagyū arc he was able to cut a
          steel sword with one hand. Swordsmanship: Niten Ichi-ryū (二天一流;
          literally meaning: "Two Heavens as One Style") - he created the two
          sword style by wielding a katana on the offensive right hand while the
          Wakizashi on the defensive left hand. He questioned himself why
          Japanese swordsman only use one sword during fights. He displayed full
          use of the two sword against Tsujikaze Kōhei/Shishido Baiken. One of
          the secrets of the technique is to throw the wakizashi blade like a
          shuriken/kunai.
